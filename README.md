# Docker Installer

A shell script that helps in installing the docker daemon with several additional configurations

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

In order to use the shell script it's necessary to have GIT installed on a Linux Ubuntu machine.

### Installing

The recommended way to obtain the script is cloning the git repository as follows:

```
git clone https://github.com/sirnino/docker-installer.git
```

If you don't have git installed you can download the software from [here](https://github.com/sirnino/docker-installer/archive/master.zip) (note that you won't be able to update the software with the new releases).


## Deployment

In order to make the script working, you have to assign it the proper permissions. To do this you can run:

```
chmod +x docker-setup.sh
```

Now that the script is properly configured, you can launch it, as follows:

```
./docker-setup.sh
```
